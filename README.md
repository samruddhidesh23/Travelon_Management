# 🚀 Travelon_Management

## Project Overview

TravelOn is a comprehensive Full-Stack Web Application designed to streamline the process of booking travel tickets. It offers a secure, role-based access system powered by JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. The platform is divided into three primary modules — User, Driver, and Admin — each tailored to meet the specific needs of different stakeholders.

The system enables users to register, log in, search routes, view ticket prices, and book tickets seamlessly. Drivers can view their assigned trips, while the admin has full control over managing users, drivers, routes, and booking records through a feature-rich Admin Panel.

This project emphasizes data security, efficient performance, and a user-friendly interface. It leverages React for dynamic frontend experiences, Spring Boot for robust backend operations, and PostgreSQL for reliable data management.
